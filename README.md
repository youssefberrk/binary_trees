# Project 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This project is a part of the curriculum in the C programming language, focusing on binary trees. In this project, you will learn about binary trees, their traversal techniques, insertion, deletion, and various operations that can be performed on them.

## Introduction
Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science due to their efficient nature for organizing and searching data.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project include:

1. Understanding the fundamentals of binary trees.
2. Implementing binary tree data structures and related algorithms in C.
3. Practicing different tree traversal methods such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order.
4. Implementing insertion and deletion operations for binary trees.
5. Understanding and implementing tree balancing techniques like AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of binary trees. The tasks are designed to gradually increase in complexity, allowing you to build a strong understanding of binary trees and associated algorithms.

Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **0. New node:** Write a function that creates a new binary tree node.
2. **1. Insert left:** Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
3. **2. Insert right:** Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
4. **3. Delete:** Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.
5. **4. Is leaf:** Write a function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
6. **5. Is root:** Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.
7. **6. Pre-order traversal:** Write a function that performs pre-order traversal on a binary tree.
8. **7. In-order traversal:** Write a function that performs in-order traversal on a binary tree.
9. **8. Post-order traversal:** Write a function that performs post-order traversal on a binary tree.
10. **9. Height:** Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.
11. **10. Depth:** Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
12. **11. Size:** Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree.
13. **12. Leaves:** Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree.
14. **13. Nodes:** Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
15. **14. Balance factor:** Write a function that computes the balance factor of a binary tree.
16. **15. Is full:** Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full.
17. **16. Is perfect:** Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
18. **17. Sibling:** Write a function that finds the sibling of a node in a binary tree.
19. **18. Uncle:** Write a function that finds the uncle of a node in a binary tree.
